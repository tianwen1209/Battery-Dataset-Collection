### Abstract

This repository presents the largest unified and meticulously categorized collection of publicly available battery datasets. It is designed to accelerate global research efforts by offering researchers seamless access to critical data. By providing comprehensive indexing and clear metadata, this repository aims to become an indispensable resource for battery innovation, contributing significantly to advancements in sustainable energy and technology.

### Introduction

Battery research is pivotal in addressing the global energy transition and sustainability challenges, significantly influencing sectors like electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and consumer electronics. Despite numerous datasets being available, their fragmented distribution severely hinders efficient and impactful research. Our initiative solves this critical bottleneck by integrating all available open-source battery datasets into a single, easily accessible, and systematically categorized repository.

### Dataset Collection and Categorization

Our rigorous approach involved collecting datasets from international repositories, academic journals, public databases, and industry sources. Each dataset has undergone comprehensive validation and categorization to ensure data quality, consistency, and ease of use, indexed specifically by:

* Battery Chemistry (e.g., Li-ion, Lead-acid, Solid-state)
* Data Type (e.g., Cycling Data, Degradation Data, Thermal Data)
* Application Area (e.g., Electric Vehicles, Grid Storage, Portable Electronics)

Datasets contain detailed metadata: DOI, original source, data size, experimental methods, conditions, and summaries of key findings.
