### Abstract

This repository provides a unified collection of publicly available battery datasets, systematically categorized for convenient access by researchers. Datasets are indexed according to chemistry, data type, and application area, allowing efficient navigation and retrieval.

### Introduction

Battery research has become increasingly significant with the rise of applications such as electric vehicles and renewable energy storage. However, accessing relevant datasets often remains challenging due to their fragmented distribution. This repository addresses this issue by compiling battery datasets from multiple open sources into a single, easily navigable location.

### Dataset Collection and Categorization

Datasets were collected from various public platforms, scientific publications, and institutional databases. Each dataset has been reviewed, classified, and indexed according to:

* Battery Chemistry (Li-ion, Lead-acid, etc.)
* Data Type (Cycling data, Degradation data, Thermal data)
* Application Area (Electric vehicles, Grid storage, Consumer electronics)

Datasets include standard metadata: DOI (if available), source, data size, experimental conditions, and concise descriptions.
